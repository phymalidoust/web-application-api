The project was carried out by Mohammad Alidoust.

##Project description:

The project involves building a web application using Flask, FastAPI, and Django including a backend part and a Frontend part. 
The application will allow users to upload CSV/json files, perform data analysis on the data, and visualize the results. The data analysis and visualization will be performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
The application will also implement the OpenAPI specification to provide a RESTful API for accessing the data analysis results. The API will be documented using Swagger UI.
Finally, the application will be containerized using Docker and deployed using Kubernetes for scalability.
